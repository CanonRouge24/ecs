  CanonRouge24's KA Game Library/Engine v0

  Note: Anything written in this scratchpad is only in regards to getting the
  code to function on KA. In order to get the full experience while judging or
  enjoying, I highly recommend you hop on over to GitHub to give the repo a
  peek: https://github.com/CanonRouge24/ecs. All I have here is a misleading
  representation of the library's intended use.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ideally what should happen is the end user writes a JS-object-like (or
  perhaps one of the other many text markup language formats) representation of
  their desired Components and Systems, and then initialize the program. Then,
  the format is parsed and the respective classes are constructed dynamically,
  bypassing the need to manually include boilerplate to register and link the
  components, signatures, and systems. Default implementations of common
  component types should also be included and easily accessible.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  More than half of the difficulty in getting this entire project working was
  figuring out how to get the module files working on KA. First was sussing out
  the correct link to use with jsdelivr, then getting the correct commit hash
  (I was developing on a branch and using the branch name does NOT result in the
  latest commit on that branch), and then figuring out different methods to try
  and get the code imported, either as a whole or through the `import` statement

  It turns out that several features don't work great in KA (big surprise,
  amirite). You can't have an importmap script, which means importing code tends
  to result in these big long url strings. It works, alright, but looks silly.
  The alternative is using a non-module type script and using the dynamic
  `import` function. Perhaps that would allow us to create our own importmap.
  (I'll try that in the future)

  Another thing with KA is that it has a live-update editor, leading to all
  sorts of quirks with how the document reloads. One effect this has is that
  the script only runs its code once (when imported) but the canvas changes upon
  reload. If you choose naively to get the canvas context within the script main
  body, the project will run ONCE upon PAGE (re)load but not after clicking the
  restart button or editing anything in the live editor. Another is that using
  `requestAnimationFrame` will create an entirely new main loop upon restart or
  code edit, leading to a large amount of lag very quickly. We need to remove
  all active ones (ideally just one) before starting our new instance of a main
  loop.

  One other thing I learned is that switching tabs or windows leads to some
  inconsistent behavior — most of the squares have "fallen to the bottom off-
  screen", but don't spawn back in and continue falling until you come back to
  the tab. My guess is that the delta time calculations produce a singular very
  large value between the frame you left/the canvas is unloaded and when you come
  back, causing all the squares to teleport to the bottom and be moved back to
  the top on the next frame. Perhaps that can be fixed with a maximum allowed
  deltaTime, which I can test soon. Not for the contest release version, though.

  Another problem is that the files don't seem to be able to access the global
  scope. In order to get the code to work, I have to pass in the canvas and
  context to the code instead.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  But, like I said, this isn't even the intended use case for this, seeing as
  just about all the code that should even be dealing with the canvas drawing is
  defined by the user in a normal script. Look forwards to seeing that happen!
