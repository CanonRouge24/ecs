    <!--
    KA has an issue with allowing `importmap` scripts, claiming that the
    importmap is added AFTER a module script was executed. Whether that's one
    of my scripts being loaded first for no reason or because KA has module
    scripts elsewhere before the sandbox runs and that counts, I don't know.

    <script type="importmap">
      {
        "imports": {
          "ecs": "./modules/ECS.mjs",
          "types": "./modules/Types.mjs",
          "vec2d": "./modules/Vector.mjs",
          "helper": "./modules/Helper.mjs"
        }
      }
    </script>
    -->

    <script type="module" src="Main.mjs"></script>
  </body>
